= PubNub Framework
:sectanchors:

The _PubNub_ framework project allows you to build standalone framework bundles which can be copied right into your application. +

To build the framework as a standalone bundle, perform the following:

1. Clone the PubNub master repository
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:pubnub/objective-c.git
----

1. Navigate to root of the cloned repository

1. Run the CocoaPods ```pod install``` command to pull out all required dependencies

+
[source,bash]
----
pod install
----

1. Open the _PubNub.xcworkspace_ from the PubNub repository in Xcode.

1. Select the _Framework_ or _Universal Framework_ target and hit `Cmd+B` to build the selected type of framework.

1. Navigate to the _Framework_  directory and find the *Products* directory.

1. Copy the _.framework_ bundles from the *Products* folder to your application manually, or allow Xcode to do it for you by dragging and dropping the files into the project tree.

1. Click on *"+"* and select both the _PubNub.framework_ and _CocoaLumberjack.framework_ files.

*NOTE*: If the _PubNub_ target has been used, then the framework will be generated only for the selected platform (device or simulator.) If you try to use the framework to compile for another platform, *it will crash during run-time!* Using the _PubNub-Universal_ build target (which can be used on both device and simulator) will help mitigate any sort of crash scenarios during development.

Now that these steps are complete, let's learn more about xref:framework-use[how to use the framework in your app].

[[framework-use]]
== Using the framework with your app

At this point, you should have the framework added to your application project, and depending on your project's language (Objective-C or Swift), we'll need to make your project aware of the PubNub framework.

* For an Objective-C project, you need to import the _PubNub_ headers in classes where it will be used.
+
[source,objc]
----
#import <PubNub/PubNub.h>
----

* For a Swift project, you will need to import the _PubNub_ module in files where it will be used.
+
[source,swift]
----
import PubNub
----

== Additional Support
At this point, you should have a compiling project.  If not, contact us at support@pubnub.com and we'll help get you unstuck.
