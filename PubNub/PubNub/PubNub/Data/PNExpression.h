/**
 @brief      Class describe comparison expression unit.
 @discussion Comparison predicate requires two expression to run comparison operation on them. This
             class allow to construct instance for comparison. Class also make it possible to run 
             verification on passed data types and for dynamicly evaluated expression.

 @brief      Construct expression using format string.
 @discussion It is possible to describe complex expression for comparison using this method. Using
             this method it is possible to describe expression which is able to use values from 
             published message \b meta dictionary for calculations.
 @note       By enclosing string or \c %@ into quotes (single or doubled) in format string 
             expression will be instructed to treat this value as constant. If string not enclosed 
             into quotes - it will be trated as key from published message \b meta dictionary.
 @warning    May throw an exception in case if expression contain any comparison or compounding 
             tokens (like &&, || and other).
 @discussion \b Example:
 
 @code
PNExpression *expression = [PNExpression expressionWithFormat:@"numA + numB - %@", @6, nil];
 @endcode
 Expression above allow to use values \c numA and \c numB from \c meta dictionary of published
